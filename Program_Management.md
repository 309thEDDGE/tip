TIP Program Management
 
This is based on Agile Scrum.
Prioritized Requirements – Contained in the GitLab Issue board
Progress Reporting – 2-week sprints, bi-weekly software demos, To-do/Doing/Review/Done lists, burndown chart (tentative)
Forecasting – Each issue is given an effort level (points, estimated by developers).  Every sprint we will get a better idea of how many points we get done per sprint.  This velocity can be used in forecasting.
Product Owner – makes decisions about product features and priorities; single voice of the customer to the development team
Scrum Master – helps protect the team from distractions and clear impediments
Development team – does the work of creating the product
Stakeholders – customer, project director, etc.
Scrum team – includes product owner, scrum master, development team
Sprint planning
Each sprint begins with the scrum team establishing a sprint goal aligned with the release goal. They also identify the requirements from the product backlog that support the sprint goal and plan the individual tasks it will take to complete each requirement to deliver potentially shippable functionality by the end of the sprint.
Sprint review (a.k.a. sell-off)
At the end of every sprint, the scrum team meets together with the project stakeholders to inspect and adapt the product by reviewing the sprint goal and demonstrating the working product functionality completed during the sprint. The sprint review is the opportunity for the product owner to gather feedback from stakeholders to help determine if the scrum team is delivering the desired value to the customer. The feedback received is added to the product backlog and prioritized by the product owner for consideration in future sprints.
Sprint retrospective
 The scrum team inspects their processes at the end of every sprint during the sprint retrospective. By exploring what went well and what did not go well, the scrum team gathers data and insights of the previous sprint to establish an action plan for improvement, and then executes the plan during an upcoming sprint.
