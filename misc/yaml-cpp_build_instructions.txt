1. Download source:(I downloaded 0.6.0)
	a. https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp
	b. Or yaml-cpp 0.6.0 from MCCR

2. Make a build directory in the source and navigate to it (Visual studio native tools command line works as an option)
	a. mkdir build
	b. cd build

3. Update the CMakeLists.txt (These options are already in the file, just make the ON/OFF adjustments)
	a. option(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS "Build Shared Libraries" OFF)
	b. option(MSVC_SHARED_RT "MSVC: Build with shared runtime libs (/MD)" ON)

4. Run cmake commands
	a. cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64"
	b. cmake --build . --config Release

5. Make sure the preprocessor YAML_CPP_NOEXCEPT is set properly in exceptions.h
	a. sometimes _MSC_VER is defined and “_NOEXCEPT” doesn’t work and needs to be replaced with “noexcept”
		i. #define YAML_CPP_NOEXCEPT noexcept 

6. Add the library and library path to the project
	a. Path (yaml-cpp-yaml-cpp-0.6.0\build\Release)
	b. Library (libyaml-cppmd.lib)
	
7. Add the include directories path to "Include Directories" in project properties
	a. yaml-cpp-yaml-cpp-0.6.0\include
	
8. Include YAML functionality with #include "yaml-cpp/yaml.h"
