#
# parse_chunk_bytes
#
# Quantity of bytes, in units of millions, ingested for parsing by each worker thread. Usually 
# in range [20, 600]. 
#
parse_chunk_bytes: 200

#
# parse_thread_count
#
# Quantity of simultaneous threads. As a general rule of thumb, use 3/4 of your logical processors.
# Valid ranges are [1, Cores * 1.5].
# Consider that at least parse_thread_count * parse_chunk_bytes of memory will be consumed.
#
parse_thread_count: 2

#
# max_chunk_read_count
#
# Maximum quantity of worker threads that will be started to ingest and parse the ch10 file.
# Total parse size = parse_chunk_bytes * max_chunk_read_count. If total parse size is less than
# ch10 file size, the ch10 file will not be fully parsed.
#
max_chunk_read_count: 1000

#
# worker_offset_wait_ms
#
# Duration in millisecond to wait after each worker starts, only for the initial set of parse_thread_count 
# workers. Staggered start time distributes IO load. Normally in range [500, 10000].
# 
worker_offset_wait_ms: 200

#
# worker_shift_wait_ms
#
# Duration in millisecond to wait before checking workers' states. Normally in range [20, 500].
# 
worker_shift_wait_ms: 200
