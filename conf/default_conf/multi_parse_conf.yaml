# DTS_config_path_maps 
#
# If "AircraftCometName" is not specified in the xml file,
# folder names in the chapter10 path will be searched for matches with keys
# specfied in DTS_config_path_maps. If there is a match between
# a folder name and a key in the DTS_config_path_maps (case insensitive), the value 
# from the key, value pair will be checked to see if the associated DTS file exists in the dts_database_path. If the
# dts file with the "value" exists in the dts_database_path, it will be used for translation.
#
# --example--
# DTS_config_path_maps:
#   {
#     conf1: config_1,
#     conf2: config_2
#   }
# chapter10 path (missing "AircraftCometName" from xml) = C:\Users\conf1\chapter10.ch10 
#     -> use config_1_ICD.yaml for translation if config_1_ICD.yaml exists in dts_database_path
# chapter10 path (missing "AircraftCometName" from xml) = C:\Users\CONF2\chapter10.ch10 
#     -> use config_2_ICD.yaml for translation if config_2_ICD.yaml exists in dts_database_path
