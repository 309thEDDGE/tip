# vote_threshold 
#
# Bus mapping is used to associate a 1553 channel ID recorded in 
# the chapter 10 to a bus name found in the 1553 DTS file.
# One method is to use tmats, if it is correct, by setting 
# use_tmats_busmap: True, or by using a voting method by setting
# use_tmats_busmap: False.
#
# The bus map vote method uses the transmit/recieve command words
# off the 1553 bus and matches them to a transmit/recieve command
# word in the 1553 DTS file. If a transmit/recieve command word
# from a given channel ID matches a transmit/recieve command word
# from the 1553 DTS file, the channel ID votes for the bus/buses associated
# with the transmit/recieve command word from the 1553 DTS file. 
# (Note: word count is ignored from transmit/recieve command word matching)
# IF there are a lot of different 1553 buses recorded in the chapter 10 
# and not enough command words provided through the 1553 DTS file AND
# not a lot of traffic exists on one of the buses, there is a chance
# that the channel ID with lower traffic could be mapped to the wrong bus.
# vote_threshold can be used to help prevent this issue. To create a final 
# channel ID -> bus name mapping, the bus votes from a given channel ID
# must be >= vote_threshold.
#
# A good threshold can be found from trial and error. It greatly depends
# on how complete the 1553 DTS file is and the amount of bus traffic
# on each bus. The vote_threshold is not used when use_tmats_busmap = true
# Valid ranges are [1, INT_MAX].
